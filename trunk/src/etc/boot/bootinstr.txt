For DEC RX11 Floppy Disks and the IBM compatable ROM boot
programs, assemble rxboot.s, strip a.out, and then copy a.out
to /dev/fdn; where n is the disk you desire.  Then assemble
rxboot2.s, and strip it.  If the command ldrxboot has not
been compiled, do a cc -O -s on ldrxboot.c and move a.out
to ldrxboot. Finally, type "ldrxboot n rxboot2" to install
the second level boot program.
