Mkfs has been modified to create the free list in reverse order with the
blocks interleaved by threes.  This makes the free blocks on the floppy
disk closer to the inodes and tries to minimize head movement.

To get the old version of mkfs, edit mkfs.c and comment out the line
containing  '#define BACKWDFLIST	0'.  Then recompile the 
program.
