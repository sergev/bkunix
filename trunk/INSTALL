		Building BKUNIX

This file describes how to build BKUNIX from the source package.

1.  Install the cross-development system.

    Just `cd' to the directory cross-devel/ and type

	make
	make install

    The following utilities will be installed to /usr/local/bin:

	pdp11-cc	- front end for Ritchie's C compiler
	pdp11-pcc	- front end for Johnson's portable C compiler
	pdp11-asm	- AT&T assembler
	pdp11-ld	- linker
	pdp11-ar	- archiver
	pdp11-disasm	- disassembler
	pdp11-nm	- object name list utility
	pdp11-size	- object size utility
	pdp11-strip	- object strip utility

    Some files will be installed to /usr/local/lib/pdp11:

	c0		- first pass of Ritchie's C compiler
	c1		- second pass of Ritchie's C compiler
	ccom		- Johnson's portable C compiler
	cpp		- C preprocessor
	c2		- optimizer for assembler output of C compilers
	asm2		- second pass of AT&T assembler
	opcode.tbl	- instruction code table for AT&T assembler
	libcrt.a	- run time library for long and unsigned arithmetic

    You want to install to another directory, edit the cross-devel/Makefile
    and set DESTDIR to the name of target directory.

2.  Build and install the C library for target system.
    Enter src/libc/ directory and type

	make
	make install

    The following files will be installed into /usr/local/lib/pdp11:

	crt0.o		- C runtime startoff routine
	libc.a		- standard C library

3.  Install the filesystem utility. Go to fsutil/ directory and type

	make
	make install

    The "u6-fsutil" binary will be installed to /usr/local/bin.
    If you want to install to another directory, edit the fsutil/Makefile
    and set DESTDIR to the name of target directory.

4.  To build BKUNIX disk images, enter src/ directory and type

	make

    The kernel and utilities will be compiled and two disk images built:

	root.dsk	- bootable root filesystem
	usr.dsk		- empty filesystem to be mounted on /usr

    You can explore the contents of disks by typing:

	u6-fsutil -v root.dsk

5.  To run the system you will need SIMH emulator "pdp11" installed
    somewhere in the path. Enter src/ directory and type:

	make run

    On "rx boot:" prompt type "lsx". You will get root shell prompt "# ".
    To exit from SIMH, type ^E then q and press Enter.

    You can download the sources of SIMH from the Computer History
    Simulation Project page (http://simh.trailing-edge.com).
