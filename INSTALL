		Building BKUNIX

This file describes how to build BKUNIX from the source package.

1.  Install the cross-development system:

	make -C cross-devel install
	make -C src/libc install
	make -C fsutil install

    The following utilities will be installed to /usr/local/bin:

	pdp11-cc	- front end for Ritchie's C compiler
	pdp11-pcc	- front end for Johnson's portable C compiler
	pdp11-asm	- AT&T assembler
	pdp11-ld	- linker
	pdp11-ar	- archiver
	pdp11-disasm	- disassembler
	pdp11-nm	- object name list utility
	pdp11-size	- object size utility
	pdp11-strip	- object strip utility
        u6-fsutil       - filesystem utility

    Some files will be installed to /usr/local/lib/pdp11:

	c0		- first pass of Ritchie's C compiler
	c1		- second pass of Ritchie's C compiler
	ccom		- Johnson's portable C compiler
	cpp		- C preprocessor
	c2		- optimizer for assembler output of C compilers
	libcrt.a	- run time library for long and unsigned arithmetic
	crt0.o		- C runtime startoff routine
	libc.a		- standard C library

    You want to install to directory other than /usr/local, use DESTDIR=path option:

	make -C cross-devel install DESTDIR=~/.local
	make -C src/libc install DESTDIR=~/.local
	make -C fsutil install DESTDIR=~/.local

2.  To build BKUNIX disk images, enter src/ directory and type

	make

    The kernel and utilities will be compiled and two disk images built:

	root.dsk	- bootable root filesystem
	usr.dsk		- empty filesystem to be mounted on /usr

    You can explore the contents of disks by typing:

	u6-fsutil -v root.bkd

3.  To run the system you will need BK emulator installed
    somewhere in the path. Enter src/ directory and type:

	make run

    On "boot:" prompt type "bkunix". You will get root shell prompt "# ".
    To exit from the simulator, close the BK window.

    You can download the sources of BK emulator from Github
    (https://github.com/emestee/bk-emulator).
